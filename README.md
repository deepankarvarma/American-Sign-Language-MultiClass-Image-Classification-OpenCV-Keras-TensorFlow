# American Sign Language Detection using Multiclass Classification

This repository contains Python code for an American Sign Language (ASL) detection project using multiclass classification. The project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) and MobileNetSSD_deploy for object detection. The trained model achieves an accuracy of 91%. The code provides options for users to predict signs from both images and videos.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found on Kaggle: [ASL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset). It consists of a collection of images representing different letters and gestures in American Sign Language.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

2. Download the ASL dataset from the provided link and place it in the appropriate directory.

3. Run the script to predict signs from an image:

```
python predict_image.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

4. Run the script to predict signs from a video:

```
python predict_video.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` and `path/to/your/video.mp4` with the actual paths to your desired image and video files, respectively.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 91% on the ASL dataset. You can modify the code and experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters to potentially improve the performance.
